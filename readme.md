# Formative 1.2 - Coding A UI
###### :space_invader: Yoobee UI Design and Coding Assessment :space_invader:

### The Beginning
This project stemmed from a UX Research Project made by the _Delicious Designers_. The team - Bee Currie, Matt Brown, Monique Tickle and Rane Magno (me!) :smile:

I have developed the website based of the final prototype of the design team. :clap:

### What is this?
A website that gives Yoobee Students access to the discounts that their YooCard provides. _YooCard is a fictional product._
